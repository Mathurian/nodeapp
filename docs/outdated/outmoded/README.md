## Policy for This Directory

### When to Move Files Here

Files should be moved to this directory when they are:

1. **Temporary session summaries** - No longer relevant after integration into permanent docs
2. **Superseded documentation** - Replaced by more comprehensive or accurate documentation
3. **Historical analysis reports** - Valuable for reference but not current guidance
4. **Completed work plans** - Work completed and documented elsewhere
5. **Point-in-time status reports** - Status has changed significantly

### When NOT to Move Files Here

Do NOT move files that are:

1. **Current reference material** - Still actively used
2. **Permanent documentation** - Part of official documentation structure
3. **Active plans** - Currently being executed
4. **Essential configuration** - Required for operation
5. **README files** - Main project documentation

### Retention Policy

Files in this directory:

- Are preserved for historical reference
- Should not be updated or maintained
- May be purged after 1 year if not referenced

## Restoration
